"""The import-hygiene gates — the reusable module must never reach back into the app.

``yahir_reusable_bot`` is the clean core future bots import (D-01). Its whole value is a
ONE-WAY dependency: the host app may import the module, but no module file may ever import
``weatherbot`` (or any ``weatherbot.*`` submodule). A second, softer contract guards the
module's PUBLIC SURFACE: no ``def``/``class``/parameter/annotation NAME may carry a weather
noun (``weather|forecast|location|openweather|\\buv\\b|briefing``) — so the relocated code
reads as a generic bot core, not a weather bot in disguise (D-11/D-13). Docstrings and
comments are PROSE and are deliberately ignored (the retry engine legitimately mentions
"OpenWeather"/"Discord"/"briefing" in its prose — that is out of scope, deferred to DOCS-01).

Three standing gates enforce this, each paired with a self-proof — exactly the discipline of
``tests/test_oracle_selfproof.py``: a guard is only trustworthy if a deliberately-injected
violation is PROVEN to trip it. So every gate has TWO halves:

1. The REAL module tree must PASS the gate (the scaffold/relocated code is clean).
2. A deliberately-injected leak/noun, run through the SAME gate logic, must FAIL — wrapped in
   ``pytest.raises(AssertionError)`` (or asserting the helper flags it). The self-proofs call
   the SAME module-level helpers the gates use (``_scan_app_leaks`` / ``_public_names``), NOT a
   copy — so a green self-proof proves the REAL gate logic bites, not a parallel reimplementation.

These are ordinary STANDING pytest asserts, NOT ``xfail`` markers (an ``xfail`` reads inverted —
a "passing" expected-failure is itself a failing assertion — and was rejected for the oracle
self-proofs too). They go RED the instant a real leak/noun is introduced OR the instant a gate
is silently weakened. This file is the STANDING gate phases 23–27 re-run as each real surface
moves into the module (D-13).

The three gates are complementary:
- The grimp graph gate is STATIC — it sees module-import-time AND function-local AND
  TYPE_CHECKING edges (grimp counts TYPE_CHECKING imports by default; we KEEP that default so
  the gate catches a type-only app import — passing ``exclude_type_checking_imports=True`` would
  HIDE the very leak the gate exists for).
- The isolated-import smoke gate is DYNAMIC — it imports every module with the ``weatherbot``
  namespace blocked, catching module-import-time + TYPE_CHECKING-realized leaks loudly. (A purely
  function-local app import only trips if the function runs; the grimp static gate is the
  authority for those — that is why PKG-01 asks for both.)
- The AST litmus is a NAME scan over the public signature surface — prose-immune by construction.

    The render-cycle (``render_embed`` ↔ ``PanelView``) was resolved by OWNERSHIP, not by a
    deferred in-function import: ``render_embed`` stays app-side and is INJECTED into the module
    ``PanelKit`` as ``render`` at the composition root, and the module owns the panel view. This
    gate is the explicit SC#2 proof — it reads the source of the two former cycle endpoints and
    asserts NEITHER still names an ``import`` of the other symbol. It reddens the instant either
    deferred edge is reintroduced.

    The forbidden tokens are BUILT FROM PARTS at runtime (``"import" + " " + symbol``) so this
    test's OWN source carries no literal ``import PanelView`` / ``import render_embed`` string —
    a negative-grep gate must not self-invalidate a future grep over the tests tree.

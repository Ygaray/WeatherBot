"""The app cosmetic panel contributions — the WeatherBot-specific panel UI (Phase 27, D-03).

After the Phase-27 adapter relocation (SEAM-07) the generic persistent-view machinery
(``timeout=None`` + ``add_view``, the operator gate, the per-callback failure-isolation
envelope + ``View.on_error``, the registry-derived command buttons, the single clone path,
the ownership test) lives in :class:`yahir_reusable_bot.discord.panelkit.PanelKit`. What
STAYS app-side here is irreducibly WeatherBot UI:

- :class:`LocationSelect` — the location dropdown (``custom_id="wb:loc:select"``); its
  callback ``set``s the injected generic :class:`SelectedContext` (D-02) and re-renders the
  panel in place via the module's clone path.
- :class:`ForecastButton` — the 2×2 forecast-grid sub-buttons (``wb:fc:…``) carrying
  ``(command_name, variant)``; their callback routes through the module ``PanelKit``'s single
  command dispatch via an app-encoded ``"<name>|<variant>"`` dispatch key (the app dispatch
  closure decodes it + builds the ``ForecastFlags`` DIRECTLY — no user text reaches the
  parser, Security V5).
- the ``wb:`` custom_id literals + the locked emoji/label tables (these full literals
  legitimately live app-side per D-04 — the module bakes no ``wb:``).
- :func:`build_contributors` — the :data:`PanelKit`-shaped contributor callables (each a
  clone factory returning FRESH callback-bearing items per call, re-invoked by the module's
  clone path to dodge the live-routing trap — Pattern 1a).
- :data:`PANEL_MARKER`, :data:`PANEL_COMMAND_NAMES`, :data:`PANEL_LABELS`,
  :data:`PANEL_EMOJI`, :data:`PANEL_COMMAND_ROWS` — the app-supplied data the composition
  root threads into the module ``PanelKit``.

The module is constructed at the single composition root (``wiring.py build_runtime``); the
``render`` (the app ``render_embed``, via the ``_render_bridge`` closure) is injected there,
NOT imported here — which is what kills the old ``panel→bot`` module-top import edge (SC#2).

Three load-bearing correctness mechanisms (verified against discord.py 2.7.1) now live in the
module ``PanelKit`` and ride the relocation: the single-ack defer-then-edit, the operator gate,
and the per-callback failure isolation + the clone-render live-routing fix. The app components
preserve their part: the Select ``set``s the context (never re-reads ``Select.values`` in a
button callback — Pitfall 3), and the forecast buttons build flags from the in-memory selection.
